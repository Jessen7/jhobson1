Like many traditional cab companies, Yellow Cab is feeling significant pressure from ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber. You are a recent graduate and new to the firm and are excited to learn you will have role in this engagement. Your excitement quickly turns to apprehension, however, when the partner pulls you into her office.\n",

    "\"Thanks for meeting with me,\" she says. \"This new engagement is really important to the firm, and I am happy you are on board. I heard that you have some data analytics skills. I would like you to see if you there is any data out there that might help us learn more about the situation Yellow Cab is in and if there are any interesting revenue opportunities out there that we have not thought of. You know, what is Yellow cab facing and were should they be focusing their efforts?\"\n",
